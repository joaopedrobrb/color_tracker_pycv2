### Hi! This is my Color Tracker project using Python.

In this project, I've used the libs:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- OpenCV2
- urllib

The purpose of this project is recognize patterns of colors in pictures. The case was applied in a logistics company which was suffering with frauds commited by 
drivers in the last mile process. Basically, when they deliver one package, they have to take a picture to confirm the delivery. A lot of photos was taken with the 
hands or fingers in front of c√¢mera, generating all black photos or all red photos.

With this code, we are able to identify if a photo was taken with this problems and basically identify if this is a fraud.
The code was a sucess and the company put the code inside the drivers app to block images with a high percentage of black photos.

I hope you enjoy and use the code!
